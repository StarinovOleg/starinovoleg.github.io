My name is Oleg. By profession I am a programmer, and by hobbies I am a lover of dinosaurs. 

In this blog, I want to pay special attention to the adaptation of scientific articles on dinosaurs, the peculiarities of laboratory work with fossils, fiction stories on the paleontological theme. 

For a long time I thought about the blog format and settled on the absolutely amazing static site generator technology jekyll [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Jekyll -amazing technology, not to mention a great logo. 

In the process of work, I got great pleasure.
